1. chatGPT answer on how to draw proportion of optimal action plot

prompt: how to plot a proportion of optimal actions taken by a reinforcement learning agent overtime using python?

Answer: To plot the **proportion of optimal actions taken** by a reinforcement learning (RL) agent over time in Python, follow these steps:

### **Steps**
1. **Track the optimal actions**: Keep a record of whether the agent selects the optimal action at each timestep.
2. **Compute the running proportion**: Calculate the cumulative proportion of optimal actions over time.
3. **Plot the results**: Use `matplotlib` to visualize the trend.

### **Example: Plotting Proportion of Optimal Actions Over Time**
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulated data: actions taken by the agent (1 = optimal, 0 = suboptimal)
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
timesteps = 1000  # Number of episodes
optimal_actions = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=timesteps, p=[0.3, 0.7])  # 70% optimal actions

# Compute the running proportion of optimal actions
cumulative_optimal = np.cumsum(optimal_actions)
proportion_optimal = cumulative_optimal / np.arange(1, timesteps + 1)

# Plot the proportion of optimal actions over time
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(proportion_optimal, label="Proportion of Optimal Actions", color='b')
plt.xlabel("Timesteps")
plt.ylabel("Proportion of Optimal Actions")
plt.title("Proportion of Optimal Actions Over Time")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

### **Explanation**
- **`optimal_actions`**: A list where each entry is `1` if the optimal action was taken and `0` otherwise.
- **`cumulative_optimal`**: Cumulative sum of optimal actions up to each timestep.
- **`proportion_optimal`**: Running proportion of optimal actions.
- **`plt.plot()`**: Plots the proportion over time.

### **How to Use in a Real RL Experiment**
In an RL experiment:
- Track the **true optimal action** for each state using a **Q-table** or a **policy**.
- Compare the agent's selected action with the optimal action at each timestep.
- Use the above plotting method to analyze performance trends.
